oauth
=====

This package provides a somewhat secure implementation of the oauth / openid connect spec for google identity providers.

## Usage:

Generall you want to start by creating credentials with google, generally one for development and one for production.

Then, see the `config.go` file for what options you can pass the manager.

There is also an example in the `_examples` folder.
